    <p>One person I know will want to look at my site specifically is Kayly. 
        She is a stay at home mom of two children, a boy and a girl. She is what is called a social media
    "influencer." She loves to take her kids outside to take pictures. She needs to know what the weather is like
so she can figure out if the lighting is good. She also needs to know if the cities nearby might have better weather
than right where she is. Because when it's snowing in Idaho Falls, it doesn't mean it's snowing in Rexburg!</p>
 <br><br>
 <p>Another person who will want to look at the weather on THIS site is Jackie. She is also a stay at home mom, and I really 
     do mean that she stays at home... always. However, her 6 children are all in school and for some reason they can never 
     get themselves dressed for the weather. She has to check online to see what the weather is like so her kids 
     don't overheat or freeze to death. She also has to check the weather to make sure she knows when to take her dog inside.
     She also needs to know what the weather is like so she knows how long it'll take her husband Richard to get home from work.
